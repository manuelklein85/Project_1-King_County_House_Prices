# Project_1-King_County_House_Prices
This is the first project that was created within the scope of the Data Science Bootcamp by neuefische Gmbh, Hamburg, Germany

This repository contains:

    A Jupyter notebook with the following chapters:
    Importing Python libraries and dataset
    Understanding the data
    Revising the data on basis of the insights from the previous step
    Identifying the relevant features
    Performing the linear regression
    Conclusions / Recommendations
    Outlook / Next steps

    The business presentation for the management


The task to work on was as follows:

In recent years, the range of funding options for projects created by individuals and small companies has expanded considerably. In addition to savings, bank loans, friends & family funding and other traditional options, crowdfunding has become a popular and readily available alternative.

Kickstarter, founded in 2009, is one particularly well-known and popular crowdfunding platform. It has an all-or-nothing funding model, whereby a project is only funded if it meets its goal amount; otherwise no money is given by backers to a project. A huge variety of factors contribute to the success or failure of a project — in general, and also on Kickstarter. Some of these are able to be quantified or categorized, which allows for the construction of a model to attempt to predict whether a project will succeed or not. The aim of this project is to construct such a model and also to analyse Kickstarter project data more generally, in order to help potential project creators assess whether or not Kickstarter is a good funding option for them, and what their chances of success are.
