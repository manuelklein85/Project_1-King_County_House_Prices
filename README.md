<b>The task to work on was as follows:</b><br><br>

For this project, you'll be working with the King County House Sales dataset.  The dataset can be found in the file "King_County_House_prices_dataset.csv", in this folder.

The description of the column names can be found in the column_names.md file in this repository. 

The column names are NOT clear at times. In the real world we will run into similar challenges. We would then go ask our business stakeholders for more information. In this case, let us assume our business stakeholder who would give us information, left the company. Meaning we would have to identify and look up what each column names might actually mean.  

Data Science Life Cycle Goals include Data cleaning, Data exploration and Data Visualization.

Then model this dataset with a multivariate linear regression to predict the sale price of houses as accurately as possible.
